For a long time I have used VSCode as a text editor. But after getting to know about Emacs and it's capabilities I could not resist myself from using Emacs and now I am using it primarily for my software development process.

## Main differences between VSCode and Emacs

#### 1. Free (Pricing vs Use).
We know that both text editors are free in terms of price. Emacs is free software and VSCode comes under Microsoft. When we use Emacs there is no one who is looking at our source code or is spying on us but when it comes to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/60" target="_blank">VSCode</a> this is not the case. Microsoft collects the data through telemetry. Don't believe me? Look at the picture below.

Though you can disable telemetry but you can not stop plugins that you install from collecting data.

#### 2. RAM consumption
VSCode is an electron app ( <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/330493/what-are-electron-apps-and-why-have-they-become-so-common/" target="_blank">Read More</a> ) and hence uses more RAM. So when I used to edit multiple and huge javascript files, my laptop got hanged ( 8Gb RAM ). You can not edit very large size files with VSCode. Since I heavily used google chrome and VSCode they both consumes a lot of RAM and frequently I need to force shut down my laptop.

While this is not the case with Emacs, you can edit large size files easily and hence it was just chrome consuming memory. When a long integer is 32 bits, Maximum file size editable is 2147483647 bytes (2 Gbyte).

#### 3. Development Speed
This reason to leave VSCode is more of a personal choice. In VSCode we mostly interact with UI through Touchpad. For me, I think doing the same task with keyboard is much faster and hence increase productivity.


#### 4. Customization
As an open source text editor, Emacs is fully customizable and you can even customize "E" of emacs. It gives  whole lot of power according to your needs. It's a complete ecosystem in itself, once entered into it you never need to leave it. (Like sending mails, preparing ppts/notes and whole bunch of things you can imagine)

While this is not the case with VSCode, you can install packages but not tweak its core functionality.
